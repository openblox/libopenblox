This document describes the process of contributing to OpenBlox as a
developer. This file should be considered a more in-depth version of
the "Contributing" page of the OpenBlox website, located at
https://openblox.org/contributing.


INTRODUCTION

OpenBlox uses the Git version control system, with its main repository
hosted on git.openblox.org.

The following shell commands would set up a clone of the libopenblox
repository in the directory "libopenblox" under your current
directory:

	git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
	git config --global user.email 'your.name@example.com'
	git clone https://git.openblox.org/openblox/libopenblox.git

OpenBlox uses GNU Autotools to prepare this library to be built. In
particular, libopenblox uses libtool in addition to autoconf and
automake.


GETTING INVOLVED

You can subscribe to the announce@lists.openblox.org and
devel@lists.openblox.org mailing lists. The announce list is low
traffic, and is only used to announce important events such as feature
freezes before a release. You will find more information and archives
at https://lists.openblox.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo.

You can develop and commit changes in your own copy of the repository,
and discuss proposed changes on the devel mailing list. Frequent
contributors may request write access on the same list.


SUBMITTING YOUR CHANGES

To submit a potential change to OpenBlox, send a patch containing your
changes to the devel mailing list. You will need to subscribe to the
list before you can do this.

To email a patch, you can use a shell command like `git format-patch
commit` to create a file, and then attach the file to your email. In
this case, commit may be a commit's hash, HEAD~1 for the previous
commit, HEAD~2 for the one before that and so on. This packages the
patch's commit messages and changes. To send a patch without
additional remarks, you can use a command like
`git send-email --to=devel@lists.openblox.org 0001-DESCRIPTION.patch`.


COMMITTING CHANGES BY OTHERS

If committing changes written by somebody else, commit in their name,
not yours. You can use `git commit --author="AUTHOR"` to specify a
change's author.


COMMIT MESSAGE GUIDELINES

- Start with a single unindented summary line explaining the change;
  do not end this line with a period.

- After the summary line, there should be an empty line, followed by a
  more in depth summary of your changes.

- Limit lines in commit messages to 71 characters, unless they consist
  of a single word of at most 140 characters.

- If the commit has more than one author, the commit message should
  contain separate lines to mention the other authors, like the
  following:

	Co-authored-by: John M. Harris, Jr. <johnmh@openblox.org>

- Commit messages should only contain printable UTF-8 characters.

- If a commit is related directly to a bug on the OpenBlox bug
  tracker, the commit message should contain "Bug#NNNN" on the first
  line. This can be enclosed in parenthesis, for example: "(Bug#123)"

- Use present tense: Describe "what the change does", not "what the
  change did".


BRANCHES

Development normally takes place on the master branch. Specialized
features and tasks that are expected to take a while are developed on
other branches before being possibly merged into master.


BUG TRACKER

This project uses an issue tracker at
<https://git.openblox.org/openblox/libopenblox/issues> to track bugs
and enhancement ideas.

DOCUMENT YOUR CHANGES

When you make a change to OpenBlox sources, you should update the
relevant documentation. When documenting Instance classes, we often refer
to lines of code. These references need to be updated when their
source document changes.
